## Well commented code to see:
- how to create a route
- how to create a get and post request to same route-path
- how to create more than one route
- how to create structured output using `serde`, `struct` and `Json`

Use this boilerplate for future project to integrate llm call for example
`still need Deserialize` as we use only `Serialize`
